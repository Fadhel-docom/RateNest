# RateNest — project status log

Keep this file current so work can resume without repeating anything. It is **not published**
(the Pages workflow stages only the site files listed in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`).

_Last updated: 2026-10-23, after Phase 2 was merged and deployed._

## Rules of engagement
- Work only in this repository, on branches + pull requests. Never commit to `main` directly.
- Never claim a test, audit or deployment passed unless it was actually run and observed.
- Phase 2 was approved by the owner on 2026-10-23 and is done. **Any further phase or scope change needs the owner's go-ahead.**
- Fee and buffer percentages are always entered by the user: no default or hard-coded fee rate in the code (guarded by a unit test and a static check).

## Current state
| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Phase 1 calculator | Merged (PR #1). Default result $57.29/hr matches the formula (66,000 ÷ 1,152). |
| Phase 2 (optional fee % and buffer %) | Merged (PR #8) and deployed. Both inputs default to 0%; base rate stays the headline; "rate to quote" is shown separately. |
| Unit tests | 29 pass (`node --test`), also green on GitHub Actions. |
| Static site checks | `node scripts/check-site.mjs` passes, also green on GitHub Actions. |
| Browser behaviour | Verified locally only (headless Chromium, 320/375/1280 px). Not part of CI. |
| Deployment | **Live** at https://fadhel-docom.github.io/RateNest/ — see Deployment below. |
| Dependabot | PRs #2–#6 merged one at a time on 2026-10-23; every push-triggered deploy succeeded. Actions now on checkout@v7, setup-node@v7, configure-pages@v6, upload-pages-artifact@v5, deploy-pages@v5. The Node 20 deprecation warnings are gone. No open PRs. |

## Deployment
- Earlier failures (runs `39900163673`, `39906607307`) were at "Configure GitHub Pages": `Get Pages site failed ... Not Found` — the repo had no Pages site yet.
  Fixed by the owner selecting **GitHub Actions** as the Pages source (inferred from run times; settings history is not readable). No workflow change was needed.
  `enablement: false` in those logs is the action's default input, not the cause.
- Successful deploys: manual runs `39946265757`, `39947085731`; push runs after PR #7 (`39947408325`), the five Dependabot merges
  (`39948172472`, `39948321289`, `39948525047`, `39948660934`, `39948839606`) and PR #8 (`39949497073`). Each: all steps success, GitHub deployment status `success`.
- Live content check (assistant's web-fetch tool, since its shell cannot reach github.io): `sitemap.xml` served with the canonical URL; `index.html` shows the
  title, form, `$57.29/hr`, scenario table ("Base hourly rate" header), FAQ, and the optional fee/buffer section with 0% defaults.
  The tool returns text only, so the CSS/ARIA structure of the live page was not inspected there.

## Verification log
- Local, real Chromium: 42-check behaviour suite, 6-check review-regression suite, 38-check Phase 2 suite, custom accessibility measurements
  (text contrast per element, accessible names, heading order, landmarks, focus rings, reflow at 320 px with 150%/200% text) — all pass, including the
  adjusted-result state.
- **Not run:** axe-core / Lighthouse (the npm registry is blocked in the assistant's session), screen-reader testing, Safari/Firefox, real devices,
  performance scores, Search Console.
- Known limit: at 320 px with 300% text-only zoom the page still scrolls horizontally (beyond the WCAG 200% requirement).

## Competitor findings worth remembering (verified on pages, 2026-10-23)
- Clockify: step wizard, worked examples, long FAQ, heavy signup CTAs, no copy/export, silent on input privacy.
- Upwork rate calculator: two inputs, short FAQ, no formula shown. Upwork support page states a 0–15% freelancer
  service fee per contract (the calculator page mentions 10%) — fees vary, so never hard-code one.
- Bonsai resources: calculators + templates + guides, trial-signup funnel.
- Upwork Fee Calculator URL could not be loaded during research: no claims about it.

## Backlog (none started; each needs the owner's go-ahead because it changes scope)
1. Search Console: submit `sitemap.xml` (needs the owner's Google account) — optional, no code change.
2. axe-core / Lighthouse in CI if the npm registry becomes reachable; otherwise keep the custom measurements.
3. Phase 3 — project pricing calculator: do search-intent research first and only build it if it solves a distinct user need.
4. Later phases (retainer / quote generator, guides) — after Phase 3.
